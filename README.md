# Polynomial Regression (Position Salaries)

This project demonstrates **Polynomial Regression** using the **Position_Salaries.csv** dataset.  
The goal is to predict **Salary** based on the employee **Level**, and compare Linear Regression vs Polynomial Regression for better curve fitting.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
In many real-life cases, the relationship between input and output is **not linear**.

Example:  
As the job level increases, salary may increase **non-linearly** (slow increase at first, then rapid growth).

So, we apply **Polynomial Regression** to capture this non-linear pattern.

## 📂 Dataset
File: `Position_Salaries.csv`

Columns:
- `Position` (Job role)
- `Level` (Numerical level)
- `Salary` (Target variable)

✅ We use:
- **X = Level**
- **Y = Salary**
